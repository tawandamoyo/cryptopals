# Introduction

The [cryptopals crypto challenges](https://cryptopals.com/) are a collection of exercises that "demonstrate attacks on real-world crpto". And, although quite dated, they are, by wide agreement, a great way to learn crypto basics and/or a new language. 

I'm doing them to level up on Python.
